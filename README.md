SDMX-Registry-dotNET-SOAP
=========================

An example project written in .NET C# to connect to and retrieve objects from an SDMX Registry using SDMX-ML v2.1.

This project has been written to record a test harness for the SDMX Global Registry but is also being used as a central place for code to be shared for .NET developers.

Due to the complexity of the SDMX Model and the dependency chain of the schemas it is not always obvious how to make use of the object classes generated via the WSDL wizard in Visual Studio.

This project is created in Visual Studio 2010 rather than 2012 because most corporate environments are still using 2010 at the time of writing this.
